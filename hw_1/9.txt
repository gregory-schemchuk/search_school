<div itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>The Farseer Trilogy is a <a href="https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/recommended-fantasy-series.html">recommended fantasy series</a>.</p><p>Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb is the first book in her acclaimed work, <strong>The Farseer Trilogy</strong>. First published in 1995, and followed by <a href="https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Robin-Hobb/Royal-Assassin.html">Royal Assassin</a> and <a href="https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Robin-Hobb/Assassins-Quest.html">Assassin's Quest</a>, the trilogy has been described as combining the magic of <a href="https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Ursula-Le-Guin/The-Earthsea-Quartet.html">Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea</a> with <a href="https://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/JRR-Tolkien/The-Lord-Of-The-Rings.html">J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings</a>.</p><p>The story follows a young six year old boy and his life and times once he is handed over into the care of his biological father, a royal prince. The young boy, who becomes known as Fitz, has a difficult life due to the fact that he is a royal bastard.</p><p>"'Chivalry's' the old man said, and he was already turning his back on me, taking his measured steps down the flag-stoned pathway. 'Prince Chivalry' he said, not turning back as he added the qualifier. 'Him what's King-in-Waiting. That's who got him. So let him do for him, and be glad he managed to father one child, somewhere.'"<br/><strong>Assassin's Apprentice: The Earliest History</strong></p><p>He is taken under the wing of Buckkeep's master of animals, Burrich, and it is while working for Burrich that his discovers he also has many other skills that ordinary boys do not possess.</p><p>The Kingdom is under threat from raiders who leave their victims devoid of any human emotions. The King is hard pressed and uses everything at his disposable to protect his country. Fitz, after a chance meeting with the King begins his assassin training and as he grows he must face peril, hardship and ever more difficult missions.</p><p>This tale is told using a first-person narrative, beginning as Fitz sits down and recounts his memoirs (he is now a much older man). This narrative is intense and highly enjoyable, worth reading for the author's skill with words alone. There are genuinely moving moments and you are always hoping that Fitz's life will become happier.</p><p>I would highly recommend Assassin's Apprentice and the Farseer Trilogy. As you read you become ever more immersed in the story and it just seems to get better and better.</p><p>Here's what others say:</p><p>"Refreshingly original" <strong>Jenny Wurts</strong></p><p>"I couldn't put this novel down" <strong>Starburst</strong></p><p><span class="rating">9/10</span> <em>An enjoyable and rewarding beginning to a promising trilogy.</em></p>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">I found Assassin's Apprentice and the next 2 or 3 books in the series at a book sale. I was surprised to find a number of the same author at this small sale. As I enjoy Fantasy and had never heard of Robin Hobb, and as the price was well book sale price, I bought them all. What a surprise when I started reading Book 1, entertaining, enjoyable and well worth the read. I finished the other books in the series that I had bought and quickly began purchasing and reading the rest of the books in the series. I must say Robin Hobb has become one of my favourite authors and Assassin's Apprentice and the rest of the series my favourite as well. The characters, especially Fitz, are believable and you feel what they are going through, their pain and suffering and moments of happiness. This is a series that you can easily loose yourself in and continue reading, until the series is done.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">When I first read Assassin's Apprentice, I immediately fell in love with It's prose, more beautiful than anything I've read before or since. I was entranced, fully invested from page 1. I knew within a few chapters that Robin Hobb was my new favorite author. Her prose and amazing characters kept me smiling and turning the pages, even during parts where nothing important was happening plot-wise. It's one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. Robin Hobb is a genius. When you finish one of her books, you hunger for the next. I couldn't recommend this enough. A must read!</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">Her characters are complexe and believable, the motivations are clearly explained so each character is utterly believable. They love they lose and they grieve so it is a rare book where the characters mature over time rather than stay in a rigid format. This is a rare author who gives life to her characters all of them (and there are many different characters) all different and all believable. Her plots are complicated and fullÂ of adventure but I love the feeling you have of knowing the characters and years later I will randomly think of a scene of her books, they become part of the reader. Her world is totally believable and one of the best series around. The Farseer chronicles are my favorite.</span></blockquote>

Her books are the type of you canât put down because you need to know what happens and you donât want the books to end because you feel the intense need to be with the characters you meet in her books. Her wolf building and detail of what the characters experience is a really treat. I canât believe it took me so long to hear about these books! Iâm in my mid forties and just discovered them! Robbin Hobb is truly one of the great authors in fantasy writing. These trilogies go down in my top fantasy books of all times!</span></blockquote>

The characters are so human, and over the course of the series you grow to love them like they're your friends.

Beautifully written, wonderful characters, engaging story. Everything good fantasy should be.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">The first page of this book is what made me keep reading the whole series. Somehow the idea of a small child being swung along in a warm, steady hand in a wind swept, icy street, and the way it was written completely captured a child of that age and their curiosities and their odd way of perceiving the world. The author has a way of writing that I hardly ever see where everything she wrote seemed to have been planned ahead in complete detail. But the main character gets completely bashed up, everything goes wrong and although there are happy moments the author made his life very depressing. This is definitely a fantasy-lovers book and as others have said, not for the faint-hearted. This is one of those book series that is a beautiful piece of art but not a overly happy one.</span></blockquote>

Fitz, the main character, is suppressed in every way possible. He is hurt, then kicked while he is down, again and again. But the point of the story is that he continues on each time. He raises himself up again and again. It is true that this book can get depressing at times, but it is worth it to watch as Fitz grows and becomes a exemplary man. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">There are some good ideas and characters, though some were introduced only to go nowhere, but I am guessing that they will be taken up again in the sequels. I found the protagonist sympathetic, but frustrating in the way he just lets everyone mistreat him without doing anything. And some of the adult characters close to him seem to neglect and reject him for no good reason other than to try to gain reader sympathy. I agree with another comment above that Hobb builds up slowly to conflicts which then seem to fizzle out in a few paragraphs with an unsatisfactory conclusion. But generally a very readable book which sustained my interest.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">This is perhaps the best series of books I have read. The characters are very real and not at all static. It is very easy to fall into this book and cheer at Fitz's triumphs and gnash your teeth at his failures and setbacks. The books can be very sad or depressing, but the fact that there are huge setbacks and horrible truths make it more real and gritty. Someone once said to me you cannot know how good things can be till you've seen how bad it was. Persevere, the second trilogy especially sets things to rights and it feels good. I have read and reread this series many times, which I very rarely do and is the best recommendation I can offer.</span></blockquote>

As someone else mentioned, the story can be depressing, but the series doesn't really bill itself as a peppy, happy thing to begin with. But for the complainers, approach this book as a trilogy of trilogies; it doesn't really end until Fool's Fate, when everything is finally made right. And even then, there's another growing trilogy coming along now! This is the kind of writing that you'll come back to over and over again, and will spoil you, like it has me, with its amazing craft and quality.</span></blockquote>

While reading these books I totally escaped into the story, forgetting the real world for a while, which is the best compliment I can give. "The Mad Ship" books affected me this way as well. After borrowing the 1st book from the library, I went out to buy all her books so I could read them whenever I wanted.

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">Well written and easy to lose yourself in, these series of books are an emotional rolercoaster. I couldn't put these books down, I also would recommend the Live Ship series and the Tawny Man but unfortunatly I felt Robin lost her way after that.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">The Farseer Trilogy is a must read for any fantasy fan. The first person narrative is effective and engaging, I feel a lot of empathy for Fitz. Ms. Hobb is an excellent wordsmith; the setting and the characters have been beautifully portrayed. She has definitely taken fantasy to a new horizon, devoid of any clichï¿½s, with an engaging plot and a realistic cast of characters.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">Robin Hobb is probably my favourite fantasy author and the Farseer trilogy is probably my favourite series.
It's the characters that I like the best, Fitz, Burrich, Regal, Molly and Verity are still as clear in my mind to me as they were when I was reading it a few years ago.
The bonus is that the books get better as they go along and give you the kind of ending you are hoping for, something that other series have failed to do and left me a bit disappointed.</span></blockquote>
