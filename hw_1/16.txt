<div itemprop="reviewBody">
<p>The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson is the first volume in a projected ten book epic fantasy series, set on the world of Roshar where constant storms have caused the ecology to evolve into something resembling a rock pool or a coral reef. This 1000 page door stopper is a large undertaking for many readers, and with the second book not even out yet I can understand why people would be hesitant to read this book just yet. But I'm going to recommend that you do read it anyway, that way you can join the rest of us in speculating about what might come next.</p><p>I am completing this review after my second read through of The Way of Kings, and given that Josh has already reviewed this story (please see below) I will try to keep things short and to the point. The Way of Kings follows the stories of three primary protagonists: Kaladin, Dallinar and Shallan. Each one has their own story to tell (which could probably be told in their own novel), with each story slowly helping to unveil the mysteries and secrets that define the world of Roshar. The Way of Kings is very much a journey of discovery, and the more carefully you read it, the more you will learn.</p><p>If you have read the Mistborn series, you will know how things Sanderson briefly mentions in the first chapter of the first book are actually key parts of the mysteries unveiled in the final book. You would also be familiar with Kelsier and his favourite saying - "Every secret has a secret." The Way of Kings is no different, with seemingly random sentences scattered through the book meaning absolutely nothing unless you know the context to which they apply. I am still trying to process the amount of information I learned during my re-read of The Way of Kings. The knowledge you gain during your first read in the latter parts of the book, like knowing how long it takes to summon a shardblade, will actually reveal hidden secrets about different characters during your re-read of the early parts of the book. If you loved this book and you thought you knew exactly what was going on, I implore you to read the book again and see if you change your mind. I know so much more than I did before, and it has made me realize just how little I know.</p><p>You probably noticed that both Josh and I are very vague in our description of what this book is about. The reason is that there is so much going on that you can't really describe it without making this review at least triple the size. In short, there is magic, there are swords, there are battles, there are assassins, there are giant crustaceans, there is the threat of the voidbringers who will destroy the entire world, and there are the connections between the world of Roshar, the world of Scadriel (Mistborn), the world of Sel (Elantris) and the world of Nalthis (Warbreaker). The density of material that Sanderson communicates in these 1,000 pages is immense, the learning curve is steep, but the pay-off is deeply satisfying.</p><p>So should you read The Way of Kings? It is a daunting proposition, and honestly, I would not recommend it if you are new to fantasy or new to Brandon Sanderson. Read one of his shorter works first like The Emperor's Soul. Read the Mistborn trilogy first. Read Warbreaker first (it is available as a free download from Sanderson's website). If you are an epic fantasy enthusiast and you have not read this book, finish whatever book you are currently reading and make this your next book. It is a unique experience that you should not miss out on, but only if you have done some prior preparation.<br/><em>Ryan Lawler, 9.5/10</em></p><p>--</p><p>On the 15th of January, 1990, a book entitled ‘The Eye of the World’ was released into stores by an author by the name of Robert Jordan. I sometimes wonder whether people who started reading that book knew exactly what they were getting themselves in for; whether they knew that twenty years later the series still will not have finished and would, in fact, have to be finished by another author.</p><p>I also sometimes regret not being a big reader (or in my case, being able to read) when Eye of the World came out.  I wonder what it would have been like to begin the journey that followed.</p><p>Thankfully, now I don’t have to wonder what it’s like any longer, for ironically, the man who is finishing Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series has given me the chance to wait a decade or more for a new series to fill out.</p><p>Brandon Sanderson, heir apparent to the Robert Jordan throne, has just released ‘The Way of Kings’, his first book in The Stormlight Archive series.</p><p>It is, in every sense of the word, an epic beginning to what I can only guess (and hope) will be an epic story told over, apparently, ten books with the second one nowhere near being published. In essence, Sanderson has just begun the next Wheel of Time-like series.</p><p>I wasn’t even a quarter of the way into this book before I realized I was beginning something impressive. Sanderson writes as if for his life, knowing just when to leave a point of view for another, when to bring the character back from the brink and when to test a character’s mettle.</p><p>From a purely writing standpoint Sanderson is showing himself to be one of the best. Not only is his grasp of his characters impressive, but the way that he imparts that to us is stunning. Every character seems to be intricately carved into what we read, with a mixture of flaws and qualities that make them figuratively jump off the page. The action scenes – whether they be from the lowly servants to the mystically enhanced generals – are nothing short of spellbinding and leave you breathless with anticipation throughout.</p><p>The story itself begins to challenge Steven Erikson’s Malazan Book of the Fallen for depth and scope. The prologue isn’t there just to pamper the author’s desires but really sets the scene for what is to come, so many years later. The technology, armour, weapons and magic of this world bear the standard Sanderson touch, intricately detailed to the nth degree and utterly believable, a combination that many fail to achieve.</p><p>Maybe the area in which Sanderson achieves his highest praise is in the manner with which he depicts the headspace our characters live in. Not only in their reaction and understanding of the world around them and the manner in which it reacts and has reacted to the continual storms that batter its landscape, but also in how the characters seem to be baffled by concepts that to us are normal, but in their world are foreign. Their bafflement leaves the reader similarly baffled, all too great effect.</p><p>I would love to go on about The Way of Kings, ensure that you realize this book is one that simply must be on your shelf, but I need to finish up and let it be. In the end, this book will go down as one of the best of 2010.<br/><em>Joshua S Hill, 10/10</em></p><p><span class="rating">10/10</span> <em>This book will go down as one of the best of 2010.</em></p>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">When I first began reading the novel, I winced because it lacked the potency and richness of characterization that is so necessary in epic fantasy fiction. However, Sanderson makes up for it in sheer breadth. The world he creates in the reader's mind is vast, and it is made to seems so real because Sanderson connects all of the dots whenever he can. He takes certain opportunities throughout the book to explain something about the world of Roshar to the reader. It is done in ways that I haven't ever seen before. Since I only read a few of Sanderson's novels before, I was impressed by his masterful and lithe writing style. He jumps from character to character in a single scene, offering different perspectives like an action movie, and hold the reader every second. There are some parts that I am tempted to skip, like extended conversations about philosophy between two scholars that only serve as a transition into a more important plot point. There are timeless and valuable themes and morals in this book, which is perhaps is most daring undertaking. It strives to wrestle with large ideas that are not apparent at first, and more so than any other fantasy fiction I've read. The ironic characters, the color of one's eyes, the safehand, and political tension all combine to serve a complex narrative about contemporary society in a way that even outranks the Potter series and LOTR.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">I thought this book took a long time setting things up and didn't work towards anything seriously climactic. However, the writing and development is great and enjoyable. Does the next book deliver after such a build up. It sure does. OMG, I don't think I've ever went through a book so quick. Well done! Still going, wonderful story.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">I think I fell in with Sanderson's writing when he finished up the Wheel of Time series BETTER than the man who started it! I went on to read Mistborn which set me up nicely to read The Way of the Kings. I would say that if long high fantasy books aren't your thing and if you read so slow that you will forget what the 300 pages said before where; do not read this book. This 1000+ page tome isn't for the faint of heart. You can't just slog through it. You need to remember things about it to understand, he leaves clues. That being said: 10 stars. Amazing. Has lore, warlords, species racism, soldiers, medieval battle tactics, and of course, fantasy magic. Keep in mind, it takes authors years to write this long of a book and Sanderson writes multiple at the same time. If you don't want to start this series until he is done, wait until he is finished writing them all. There is a progress bar on his website that is very informative on the stage of all his current books. Sanderson is the best of the best. He has multiple books that are top in fantasy, which should be clue enough.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">This book should be without a doubt #1 in the top 100 list I have never read a book that opened and introduced a world like this one other than Wheel of Time. The balance in this book is simply breathtaking, the world building, magic mechanics, character building and depth is awe-inspiring. Makes me feel ill at times when I read the top 100 you have here and have things like "Harry Potter" @ 26 and Wheel of Time @49, I seriously wonder at times just how these lists are made up (and sorry to upset a LOT of people but Lord of The Rings doesn't deserve to be top 20 anymore). Brandon Sanderson has his flaws but with every book he is tightening up his style and narrative and to be honest he has thrown down the gauntlet with this book and I cannot see many people being able to top this in a good while.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">I can't recommend this book highly enough. It has all the aspects of Sanderson's writing which have made him my favourite fantasy authour - a fascinating and logical magic system, characters who develop and change (rather than just being a standard RPG character profile), well-paced &amp; gripping plot with stunning twists, and a wonderfully original world (which only forms part of the 'cosmere' inhabited by all his adult fiction). If this series fulfills the promise of its first book, it may well replace Mistborn (which itself supplanted WOT) in the no. 1 spot on my book list.</span></blockquote>

The slower parts encourage you to read to the next chapter where something great is bound to happen. The end is unexpected, provides some answers and leaves the reader wanting more. Sanderson does a great job in growing his characters throughout the books! It's a must read. I'd give it 9.5/10.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">This book is one of the best modern high fantasy books I have read, only to be toppled by the Malazan series. The characters are so real you can almost hear them talk when you read the dialoges. The magic system is a fresh addition to a otherwise quite stale system in fantasy and i find the tadbits of cultural knowledge that we get here and there very good. All in all this is a book anyone who has any sort of interest in fantasy or good fiction must read!</span></blockquote>

The only bad review is some idiot who wouldn't even give the book a shot. One word of warning though, the book is absolutely brimming with masterful foreshadowing and even the small pictures at the beginning of chapters are full of hidden meaning. Once I finished the chapter "Recorded in Blood" I felt like a pawn in some huge game played with remarkable cunning. The epilogue blended the normally humorous dialogue of wit seamlessly with, not nearly so much of a cliffhanger as a taste of whats to come. </span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">I'm a high school student, one of the few that reads high fantasy books, after finishing the newest Wheel of Time I sought out another series to start and I found the Stormlight Archive. All I can say is: "Why only a thousand pages", and "How can Sanderson write something this good WHILE working on Wheel of Time..." This book is amazing, the world is well thought out, full of life, with it's very own ecosystem that bares only the slightest resemblance to our own. It is full of lore, and past history, a world already full of strife and conflict, hope and despair, when the read comes in, there is no one part that makes this book instantly amazing, it's the combination, a well thought out plot, as well as character growth, the world itself, and how interact a culture each civilization has, as well as the limits as well as the resourceful use of magic, and how ell expressed the characters inter-thoughts were, to see a writer putting so much effort into the fine details, each page is so exciting, the end of one character Point of few links to another, the transition isn't fluid, but it still feels, right. I only regret having found this book now, I have this dreaded feeling the next book in the serious will not be arriving soon, and a book as great as this makes the wait all the more painful. But, for any fantasy reader, who seeks a book that will, kill your schedule, and leave you wishing for more, read this book, hell, ANY fantasy read should read this book, it's THAT good.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">How a thousand page plus book could seem short to me, I have no idea. But I finished it and had myself a moment of horrible dispair at the realization it would probably be a couple of years, minimum before I would see a sequel, seeing as he's off finishing AMoL. I then cursed him repeatedly for dragging me into another fantasy epic, when I thought I'd be done with them after the Wheel of Time was through.
He is extremely skillful at leaving just enough information back, leaving you just at the edge of figuring it all out, but not quite there. We ride around the story looking out from other's eyes, and we share their emotions, and their gonfusion at what is going on. My only complaint was that there was not enough from the viewpoint of the major female character. Everytime we left her I wanted to go back.
Given Sanderson's high rate of output, I have high hopes that we won't have to wait too long between books.

I wasn't sure how having so many character stories going on at once was going to work, but they all are great to read about, and bring essence to the overall story. The magic is awesome, and is structured. I hate when authors allow the magic to do anything and everything and has no limits. Sanderson is so good with charactrr development and keeping to a interesting story line, it's never dry. I wish I would've stumbled on this book ten years from now, now I have to find something else to read, just to fill the time until the following books release. I recommend this book to everyone.</span></blockquote>
