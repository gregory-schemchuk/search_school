<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">I was entranced by Jacqueline Carey's writing. From the first chapter, it felt like I was reading something forbidden. With a society reminiscent of the French rococo lifestyle, but the fantasy of an alterative religious history that shapes the main foundation of this book (and series). Full of highly crafted characters you have to read in the appendix. Carey's vision of the world was enough to hold me captive, even when the book's protagonist turned into a courtesan assassin. Phedrè initially a child orphan, slave to society, learns that she is different. She does not understand why she is shunned and ignored. When her life changes, we follow the education she attains in court intrigues. Then, the book evolves into erotic machinations and the floor drops out from under you. Everything about the differences she faced in adolescence now make sense and life gets more complicated. It gets dark, on so many different levels, that we just hope she survives society's worst events toward women and the friends that keep her sane. Royal intrigue, tragedy, kidnapping, romance, high fantasy epic. All wrapped up in neat little package or three... Truly, one of my top 5 fantasy books series writers where Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson are.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">Very nearly perfect. Provided you can stomach some of the darker moments, these books will not disappoint. They do have a tendency to drag a little in the second act, but Carey more than makes up for it with her immaculate prose and exquisite descriptive powers.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span itemprop="reviewBody">I stumbled across this and Carey's subsequent Namaah Series quite by accident, but I'm so glad I did. Carey's tale of betrayal, destiny, intrigue, mysterious and ferocious magics and, most important of all, love, is one of the most well-written and thoroughly enjoyable series I have ever have the pleasure of reading. A compelling narrative and poetic writing style made the complex and interwoven plot easy to read, introducing well-rounded, flaw bitten characters to life. Phedre's character is unlike any protagonist I have ever experienced before, as through the mysteries and intrigue of the high European court in which she is thrust, her most violent battle is against herself, and unlike many 'strong' female characters, Phedre is not without vulnerability.
Although you are gifted with 6 books in the Kushiel series, you are left craving more, turning then to the Namaah series, which is like a chocolatey dessert to the hearty meal of Kushiel. A definite 10 out of 10! Recommended to lovers of historical fantasy, romance, crime and intrigue and great writing.</span></blockquote>
